## Overview
This repository contains a Python script (assignment_9_functions.py) that includes several functions designed to perform various tasks related to file handling and data analysis. Each task is encapsulated within a specific function, making the code modular and easy to understand.

## Functions
Task 1: file_top(file_handle, count)
Prints the first count lines of the specified file (file_handle). The line numbering starts at 0.

## Task 2: read_integers(file_handle)
Extracts positive integers from a file into a list of integers. Numbers are comma-delimited, and non-numeric tokens are ignored.

## Task 3: file_statistics(file_handle)
Evaluates the contents of a file by counting upper-case letters, lower-case letters, digits, white-spaces (including end-of-line characters), and remaining characters.

## Task 4: line_numbering(fh_read, fh_write)
Adds line numbers to a file. Contents of fh_write contain contents of fh_read where every line has line numbers added to the beginning of the line in the format [number]. Line numbering starts at 0.

## Task 5: student_stats(file_handle)
Gets information from a file of student information and grades. Returns the ID of the student with the lowest mark, the ID of the student with the highest mark, and the average mark.
