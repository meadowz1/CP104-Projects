I make it my duty to continue the strength and robustness of the

Whenever I get a package of plain M&Ms, 
I make it my duty to continue the strength and robustness of the 
candy as a species. To this end, I hold M&M duels. Taking two 
candies between my thumb and forefinger, I apply pressure, squeezing 
them together until one of them cracks and splinters. That is the 
“loser,” and I eat the inferior one immediately. The winner gets to 
go another round. I have found that, in general, the brown and red 
M&Ms are tougher, and the newer blue ones are genetically inferior. 
I have hypothesized that the blue M&Ms as a race cannot survive long 
in the intense theater of competition that is the modern candy and 
snack-food world. Occasionally I will get a mutation, a candy that 
is misshapen, or pointier, or flatter than the rest. 
Almost invariably this proves to be a weakness, but on very rare 
occasions it gives the candy extra strength. In this way, the species 
continues to adapt to its environment. When I reach the end of the 
pack, I am left with one M&M, the strongest of the herd. 
Since it would make no sense to eat this one as well, 
I pack it neatly in an envelope and send it to M&M Mars, 
A Division of Mars, Inc., Hackettstown, NJ 17840-1503 U.S.A., 
along with a 3×5 card reading, 
“Please use this M&M for breeding purposes.” 
This week they wrote back to thank me, 
and sent me a coupon for a free 1/2 pound bag of plain M&Ms. 
I consider this “grant money.” 
I have set aside the weekend for a grand tournament. 
From a field of hundreds, we will discover the True Champion. 
There can be only one.
